To-Do List: World Record Transaction Tracker
1. Set up the BTCPayServer for the merchant.
2. Enable the notification system inside BTCPayServer.
o Configure it to send transaction data whenever a payment is completed.
3. Connect the notification system to a spreadsheet database.
o Each settled transaction must be recorded automatically and in human-
readable format.
4. Ensure the spreadsheet contains all important transaction details:
o Date and time
o Transaction amount (BTC and fiat)
o Payment method (on-chain, NFC card, QR code)
o Transaction ID
o (Optional) Merchant name or location
5. Set up a real-time dashboard display using the spreadsheet data, showing:
o Countdown to the end of the record attempt
o Total number of transactions
o Total value received
o Average transaction amount
o Percentage breakdown by transaction type
6. Brief the participating merchants in advance.
o Let them know that a Guinness auditor may approach them during the
event
o Merchants must be ready to provide a printed or handwritten receipt
upon request for specific transactions
7. Begin the world record attempt.
o Monitor the system and ensure data is being tracked and updated in real
time
8. The Guinness auditor will collect paper receipts manually by:
o Selecting random transactions from the dashboard or spreadsheet
o Asking the corresponding merchant to provide a receipt for those
transactions
o Comparing the physical receipt with the digital record for verification
9. After the event, back up the full dataset and export the spreadsheet for final
review.
