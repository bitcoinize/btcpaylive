# Allow replication connections from the replica's network.
# Replace 'replicator' with your chosen replication username.
# Replace '172.0.0.0/8' with your docker network, or be more specific if possible.
# Often, Docker networks are in 172.16.0.0/12 or 192.168.0.0/16 ranges.
# We can use 'all' for ADDRESS if services are on the same Docker network,
# but specifying the network is safer. Let's try with '0.0.0.0/0' for now as in the article,
# and then you can restrict it later if needed.
